false positive rate (FPR)
The x-axis in an ROC curve. The false positive rate is defined as follows:

The false positive rate is {\displaystyle FPR={\frac {\mathrm {FP} }{\mathrm {FP} +\mathrm {TN} }}}{\displaystyle FPR={\frac {\mathrm {FP} }{\mathrm {FP} +\mathrm {TN} }}}
where {\displaystyle \mathrm {FP} }{\displaystyle \mathrm {FP} } is the number of false positives, {\displaystyle \mathrm {TN} }{\displaystyle \mathrm {TN} } is the number of true negatives and {\displaystyle N=\mathrm {FP} +\mathrm {TN} }{\displaystyle N=\mathrm {FP} +\mathrm {TN} } is the total number of ground truth negatives.
