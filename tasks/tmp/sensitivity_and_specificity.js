      "Sensitivity and specificity mathematically describe the accuracy of a test which reports the presence or absence of a condition. Individuals for which the condition is satisfied are considered "positive" and those for which it is not are considered "negative".
      "Sensitivity (true positive rate) refers to the probability of a positive test, conditioned on truly being positive"
      "Specificity (true negative rate) refers to the probability of a negative test, conditioned on truly being negative"
