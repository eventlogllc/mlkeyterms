Sensitivity and specificity mathematically describe the accuracy of a test which reports the presence or absence of a condition. Individuals for which the condition is satisfied are considered "positive" and those for which it is not are considered "negative".

Sensitivity (true positive rate) refers to the probability of a positive test, conditioned on truly being positive.
Specificity (true negative rate) refers to the probability of a negative test, conditioned on truly being negative.

True positive: Sick people correctly identified as sick
False positive: Healthy people incorrectly identified as sick
True negative: Healthy people correctly identified as healthy
False negative: Sick people incorrectly identified as healthy
