      "The Bellman Equation follows a specific policy and function to give you the best value based on the states, ",

      "For example, it might do 'State 0 to State 1 or State 2' and find out the optimal value and then it will find 'State 2 to State 3' and find optimal value.",
      "And then give you the most optimal value.",
