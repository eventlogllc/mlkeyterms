      "There are many types of tensors, including scalars and vectors (which are the simplest tensors),",
      "dual vectors, multilinear maps between vector spaces, and even some operations such as the dot product.",
      "Tensors are defined independent of any basis, although they are often referred to by their components in a basis related to a particular coordinate system",
