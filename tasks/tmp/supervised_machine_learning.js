      "Training a model from input data and its corresponding labels. Supervised machine learning is analogous to a student learning a subject by studying a set of questions and their corresponding answers.  After mastering the mapping between questions and answers, the student can then provide answers to new (never-before-seen) questions on the same topic.  Compare with unsupervised machine learning."
